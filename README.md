Routing Structure
app/_layout.tsx: This file will act as the global layout for your application. It can contain global navigation bars, footers, or any other common UI elements shared across different screens.
app/index.tsx: Serves as the entry point to your application. This can redirect users to the Browse section by default or show a home screen with options to navigate to Browse or File.
app/Browse/index.tsx: Contains logic and UI for browsing through saved files. It provides links to open a file in File/draw.tsx or create a new one.
app/File/_layout.tsx: Manages layout and navigation for the File folder. This includes setting up draw.tsx as the default screen and handling modal navigation to preview.tsx and export.tsx.

Key Points
The _layout.tsx in the File directory is crucial. It should be set up to handle modal dialogs for preview.tsx and export.tsx based on navigation paths.
Expo-router will automatically handle the routing based on this file structure. You just need to ensure that the navigation links in your UI match the directory and file paths.
