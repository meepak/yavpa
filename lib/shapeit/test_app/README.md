# Shapeit Test App

Using a test-runner like Jasmine, Mocha or Jest is pointless. If we can't visualize the output, we can't assume weather the result was as expected or not, therefore this app will be used as a self-dedicated test runner which will run each and every scenario on its own dedicated canvas; The canvas will should both the input and the output, and from that we can decide weather the algorithm works correctly or not.
